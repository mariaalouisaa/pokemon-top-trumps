# pokemon-top-trumps

A top-trumps inspired game made using vanilla JS, CSS and the [POKE API](https://pokeapi.co/)

Play against the computer by selecting which pokemon power on your card is the best for battle!

---

Features include: 
- GET requests to the API
- CSS flip card animation
- setInterval() used for smooth gameplay!
- Event listeners and DOM manipulation
- Visible scoreboard!

Features I still want to add:
- Allow user to change their name (add an event to player1 tag)
- Save the players high score to localStorage
