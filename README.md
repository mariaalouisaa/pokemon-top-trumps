# pokemon-top-trumps

A top-trumps inspired game made using vanilla JS, CSS and the [POKE API](https://pokeapi.co/)

Play against the computer by selecting which pokemon power on your card is the best for battle!

---

## Features include: 
- 🤖 `GET` requests to the API
- 🎨 CSS flip card animation
- ⌚ `setInterval()` used for smooth gameplay!
- ✒️ `add.EventListener`'s and DOM manipulation
- 🔢 Visible scoreboard!
- ✏️ `contenteditable` used to allow player to change their name

Features I still want to add:
- [ ] A header with a title, settings link + more
- [ ] Dark/Light mode toggle
- [ ] Save the players high score to localStorage
- [ ] Make the App responsive so it can be enjoyed on mobile devices too!
